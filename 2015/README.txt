                          ___________________


From 01/11/2024 to 30/11/2024 I will be attempting to finish 2015's
advent of code in preparation for 2024's AOC.

I _should_ spend at most one day per challenge but I refuse to use
external solutions so I may spend more time on each challenge, hence the
deadline being 30/11 rather than 25/11.  Of course, I am not restricting
myself to doing one challenge a day - that would be a waste of my time
considering they're all released.  I doubt, however, that I'll be able
to finish _earlier_ than my deadline.

I want to do this advent of code in more than one language if possible.
Here is a list of all the languages I am aware of enough to program in,
ordered from least to most confidence:

- (1) POSIX Shell
- (2) Haskell
- (3) Ocaml
- (4) Racket
- (5) Rust
- (6) JavaScript/TypeScript
- (0) Common Lisp
- (0) C
- (0) Python
- (0) C++

On the left of each language, in brackets, is a list of all the
challenges I've solved in the corresponding language.  My hope is to
have used each language in at least one challenge.  My thinking is that
due to the earlier challenges being easier to solve I'll go down the
list linearly.  When I get past challenge 10, I get to freely choose
what language I use to solve the problem.
